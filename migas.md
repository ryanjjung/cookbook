## Notes
* This recipe relies heavily on [[../Scrambled_Eggs.txt|this Scrambled Eggs]] recipe.
* If you want a less spicy version of this recipe, instead of slicing jalapeno rounds, cut the crowns off, then slice the jalapeno lengthwise. Cut all the seeds and whites out, and then slice those pepper halves into half-round slices.
* If you don't have corn tortillas, crushed up tortilla chips are a good substitute.

## Ingredients
* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 small white onion
* 2 jalapenos
* 1 roma tomato or about half a normal tomato
* 8 eggs
* 1-2 corn tortillas
* 1/2 cup (or so) shredded cheddar
* 8-ish flour tortillas

## Prep
* You'll need everything you need for Scrambled Eggs, plus a knife and cutting board for prep work and two bowls to hold ingredients.
* Cut onion in half, then each half into thin strips. Slice the jalapenos into thin rounds. Put the onions and jalapenos in an ingredient bowl.
* Slice the tomato into thin slices, then cut them in half so you have half-round slices. These go in the other ingredient bowl.
* If you're using multiple corn tortillas, stack them and cut them in half across the diameter. Stack those halves and slice them into strips.
* Follow the relevant prep instructions in the Scrambled Eggs recipe.

## Directions
0. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet at just under medium heat. When it's hot, throw in the onion and jalapeno slices. Stir these around in the oil frequently for about 5-8 minutes until the onions and jalapenos are both starting to brown a bit.
0. Turn the heat down to just above low. Add the tomatoes. Watch out for grease splatter. Smash and crush the tomatoes as they cook and soften. They will become more sauce than anything. Cook/smash them for about 3 minutes, until there's not much tomato left except for the cooked-down skins.
0. Pour in the eggs and cook using the techniques in the Scrambled Eggs recipe. About halfway through, throw in the corn tortilla strips. Immediately after stirring in the salt and pepper and putting the eggs into a mound again, top the mound with the shredded cheese. Allow it to melt a bit, until it's time to remove the eggs. Right before removing the eggs to the serving bowl, stir the melting cheese into the eggs.
0. Serve on flour tortillas. Optionally top with additional cheese or salsa.
