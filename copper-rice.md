# "Copper" Rice

## Notes

- This produces a savory, smoky, delicate flavored rice.
- This recipe should scale well. The overall rice:water ratio should be 1:1.5.


## Ingredients

- 1 cup jasmine rice (or other variety of white rice)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tbsp paprika
- 1/2 tbsp turmeric
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Tools

- Sieve
- Saucepan and lid
- Metal spoon
- Clean dishtowel
- Trivet


## Directions

0. Put rice into a sieve and wash under cold water, shaking the sieve all the while, to remove excess starch. Allow this to drain in the sink until you need it again.
0. Measure the water and add the salt to it. Stir it a bit to dissolve the salt.
0. Heat up a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the oil and let it warm up. Add the rice and stir to begin frying it.
0. Add the paprika and turmeric to the frying rice. Stir it frequently for a couple of minutes.
0. Pour in the salted water. Briefly turn the heat up to bring the water up to a simmer. As soon as the simmer has begun, reduce the heat to low and stir the rice one last time.
0. Place the lid on the saucepan. Let this cook untouched for 12 minutes (or a bit longer on an electric stove).
0. Remove from heat to a trivet. Remove the lid. Stir the rice. If any has burnt onto the bottom, try not to disturb it.
0. Place a clean dishtowel over the saucepan, then place the lid back on top of the towel. Leave it to sit at least a couple minutes, then serve.
