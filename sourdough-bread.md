# Sourdough Bread

## Notes
* Makes two loaves.
* This recipe was prepared and tested at ~6200 ft. elevation and may require
  adjustments elsewhere. The original video is
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVfJTGpXnU). It is still a good
  visual reference for the techniques described below.
* The best bread is made when the sourdough starter is very active. Feed it
  roughly four hours before using it.

## Ingredients
* 800g bread flour
* Extra bread flour for kneading surface
* 10g salt
* 350g sourdough starter
* 530mL room temp (or slightly warmer) water
* Extra 1-2 cups of hot water for baking steam

## Tools
* Whisk
* Firm rubber spatula
* Large mixing bowl
* Two smaller proving bowls
* Two clean dish towels
* Bread lame or similar razor-sharp blade

## Prep
* It helps to measure things out ahead of time.
* You will want a very tiny amount of olive oil at a time when your hands are
  quite messy. Set some aside in a tiny bowl before you begin.

## Directions
* In a large mixing bowl, whisk together bread flour and salt.
* Add water and sourdough starter. Stir together with a firm rubber spatula until
  loosely combined, scraping down the walls of the mixing bowl all the while.
  Also scrape up the flour that gathers beneath the dough as it comes together.
  All of the flour needs to be fully integrated.
* Turn out onto a well floured surface. Knead, liberally reflouring the surface
  as needed, until the dough passes the "window pane" test. That is, with your
  fingers slightly oiled, you can pick up the dough and let it stretch under its
  own weight. When you do, and the dough doesn't rip immediately, but you can still
  see light through the stretched out dough, you have kneaded enough.
* Clean the your hands. Clean the mixing bowl and dry it. Lay a clean dish towel
  over the top of the bowl and sprinkle quite a bit of flour over it. Place the
  dough lightly on the towel so it sinks into the bowl and rests. Fold the corners
  of the towel over the dough.
* Prove two hours.
* Punch down the dough and knead briefly until the dough is condensed and feels
  tough again. Re-flour the dish towel and set the dough in the bowl again as
  before.
* Prove two more hours.
* Cut the dough in half. These are to become your two loaves. For each loaf:
  * Fold the long piece of dough in half so it's a little closer to round.
  * Go around the dough, folding the outside edge to the center and pressing down,
    then rotating an eighth of the way and repeating. Do this about 16 times, or
    until you've made two revolutions of the dough.
  * Place the dough seam side down on the counter. With your hands cupped behind
    the dough, firmly press down as you scrape the entire loaf toward you. This
    works best if the surface is not very well floured. Rotate the dough one
    quarter revolution and repeat. Do this about 16-20 times, or until you've
    made 4-5 full turnings of the dough. This process smooths out the underside
    of the dough (seals the seam) and stretches out the top layer of dough.
* Once you've prepared both dough halves as described above, place them into two
  smaller proving bowls as before.
* Prove two more hours still.
* Arrange the oven racks so that one is about in the middle and the other is a
  level beneath it. Set a large baking dish with a rim in the oven on the lower
  rack.
* Preheat to 350F.
* Cut parchment paper to fit a large baking sheet. The baking sheet should be
  large enough so that the loaves will not spread out and touch each other as
  they bake. Place the loaves on the parchmented sheet.
* Using a bread lame or similar blade, score the loaves. Don't be afraid to
  cut pretty deep. This is art, but it also helps the bread spread open as it
  cooks, allowing yeast gas to escape without warping the surface of the bread.
* Put the loaves on the upper level. At the same time, pour the extra hot water
  into the preheated baking sheet. It will immediately steam and bubble, so be
  careful. Ensure both baking sheets are fully in the oven. This steam also
  contributes to an unwarped loaf top.
* Bake 55 minutes.
* You may cut into the bread as soon as it's cool enough to handle, but don't
  put the loaves directly into a storage bag. The loaf will let off steam, which
  will condense inside the bag and then soak back into the bread crust. This is
  gross. Leave the bread out overnight so it fully cools, *then* bag it.
