# Sourdough Bread

## Notes
* Makes two loaves.
* This recipe was prepared and tested at ~6300 ft. elevation and may require
  adjustments elsewhere. The original video is
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVfJTGpXnU).
* The best bread is made when the sourdough starter is very active. Feed it
  roughly four hours before using it.

## Ingredients
* 800g bread flour
* Extra bread flour for kneading surface
* 10g salt
* 350g sourdough starter
* 530mL water
* Extra 1-2 cups of hot water for baking steam

## Tools
* Whisk
* Firm rubber spatula

## Prep
* It helps to measure things out ahead of time.

## Directions
* In a large mixing bowl, whisk together bread flour and salt.
* Add water and sourdough starter. Stir together with a firm rubber spatula until
  loosely combined, scraping down the walls of the mixing bowl all the while.
* Turn out onto a well floured surface. Knead, liberally reflouring the surface
  as needed, until the dough passes the "window pane" test. That is, with your
  fingers slightly oiled, you can pick up the dough and let it stretch under its
  own weight. When you do, and the dough doesn't rip, but you can still see light
  through the stretched out dough, you have kneaded enough.
* Clean the mixing bowl and dry it. Lay a dish towel over the top of the bowl and
  sprinkle quite a bit of flour over it. Place the dough lightly on the towel so
  it sinks into the bowl and rests. Fold the corners of the towel over the dough.
* Prove two hours.
* Punch down the dough and knead briefly until the dough is condensed and feels
  tough again. Re-flour the dish towel and set the dough in the bowl again as
  before.
* Prove two more hours.
* Cut the dough in half. These are to become your two loaves. For each loaf:
  * Fold the long piece of dough in half so it's a little closer to round.
  * Go around the dough, folding the outside edge to the center and pressing down,
    then rotating an eighth of the way and repeating. Do this about 16 times, or
    until you've made two revolutions of the dough.
  * Place the dough seam side down on the counter. With your hands cupped behind
    the dough, firmly press down as you scrape the entire loaf toward you. Rotate
    the dough one quarter revolution and repeat. Do this until about 16-20 times,
    or until you've made 4-5 full turnings of the dough. This process smooths out
    the underside of the dough (seals the seam) and stretches out the top layer
    of dough.
* Once you've prepared both dough halves as described above, place them into two
  proving bowls as before.
* Prove two more hours still.
* Arrange the oven racks so that one is about in the middle and the other is a
  level beneath it. Set a large baking dish with a rim in the oven on the lower
  rack.
* Preheat to 350F.
* Cut parchment paper to fit a large baking sheet. The baking sheet should be
  large enough so that the loaves will not spread out and touch each other as
  they rest. Place the loaves on the parchmented sheet.
* Using a very sharp knife or bux cutter, score the loaves. Don't be afraid to
  cut pretty deep. This is art, but it also helps the bread spread open as it
  cooks, allowing yeast gas to escape without warping the surface of the bread.
* Put the loaves on the upper level. At the same time, pour the extra hot water
  into the preheated baking sheet. It will immediately steam and bubble, so be
  careful. Ensure both baking sheets are fully in the oven. This also contributes
  to an unwarped loaf top.
* Bake 55 minutes.
