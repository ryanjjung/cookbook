# Blueberry Ice Cream

## Notes
* Your ice cream machine needs to be cold, so freeze it overnight before making this recipe.
* Results are best when you start with a cold ice cream mixture, so refrigerate it for several
  hours before putting it into the ice cream machine.

## Ingredients
* 6 oz fresh blueberries (by weight)
* 2/3 cup granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup whole milk
* 1 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 4 egg yolks
* 1 pinch kosher salt

## Tools
* Ice cream machine
* Whisk
* Small saucepan
* Potato masher or long-tined fork for smashing blueberries

## Prep
* Wash the blueberries

## Directions
1. Combine blueberries and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to medium heat. As it boils, use a
   potato masher or fork to smash the blueberries as completely as possible.
1. Boil for about 10 minutes, continuing to smash and allowing the sugar to dissolve the mixture
   into a pasty syrup.
1. Strain the blueberry mixture, discarding the solids and retaining the syrup. Be thorough to get
   as much syrup as possible. Be careful because the syrup is boiling hot and sticky. It will also
   stain anything it touches.
1. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the cream, milk, vanilla, egg yolks, and salt until
   slightly foamy.
1. Let the syrup cool for a few minutes, then pour it into the dairy mixture and whisk it together
   again. You should now have a purple creamy mixture.
1. Refrigerate this mixture for several hours until it is cold. The colder this is before going into
   the ice cream machine the better (but not frozen, obviously).
1. When the ice cream machine is done working its magic, transfer into a container and freeze
   overnight to solidify it.
