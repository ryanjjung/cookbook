# Biscuits and Sausage Cream Gravy

## Notes
* This is a thick, heavy, stick-to-your-ribs breakfast recipe.
* If the gravy gets too thick, you can add more cream or some milk. The less fat
  is in your dairy liquid, the thinner the gravy will become.
* If the gravy is too thin, you can thicken it by mixing together a slurry of
  cream and flour in a separate container, then whisking some of it in until you
  reach the desired thickness. Longer cooking will also thicken the gravy.

## Ingredients
### Gravy
* 1 lb breakfast sausage
* 2-3 tbsp bacon grease (or butter as an alternative)
* 1/4 (or so) all purpose flour
* 16 oz. whipping cream
* Kosher salt
* Black pepper

### Biscuits
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 stick (8 tbsp) butter
* 1 cup buttermilk

## Tools
* Cast iron skillet
* Wooden spoon
* Sifter
* Whisk
* Medium mixing bowl
* Microwave safe bowl
* Long-tined fork
* Small mixing bowl
* Baking sheet
* Parchment paper

## Directions
* Place breakfast sausage into a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. This
  will continue to cook gently as you make the biscuits. Every few minutes, give
  this a stir with the wooden spoon and break the sausage down into smaller
  crumbles, rendering and retaining as much of the grease as possible.
* As that cooks, preheat the oven to 475F.
* Whisk together a dry mix of the flour (sift it first), baking powder, baking
  soda, salt, and sugar in the medium mixing bowl.
* Cut the stick of butter into cubes, place in a microwave safe bowl, and nuke
  it for 30 seconds. This leaves you with a puddle of melted butter and some
  globs of solid butter. Use a long-tined fork to stir this mixture for about a
  minute, until the solid butter is fully melted.
* Mix together the buttermilk and melted butter in a small mixing bowl. You'll
  get a sloppy, lumpy slurry.
* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
* Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and stir together to form a batter.
  Spoon large lumps of batter onto the parchmented baking sheet. There should be
  about 9-12 biscuits all told.
* Bake for 12-14 minutes, then remove from the hot baking sheet to prevent
  overcooking.
* While the biscuits are in the oven, make the gravy. When the sausage is fully
  cooked, remove it from the pan, leaving as much grease behind as possible. Add
  some extra bacon grease or butter to the pan to form about a quarter cup of
  grease.
* When the grease is hot, add the flour. 1/4 cup should be about right, but you
  can adjust this a bit if you like. The roux this forms should run a bit and
  still bubble under the heat. Fry up the roux for 1-2 minutes, whisking often.
* Add the whipping cream about a half a cup at a time, whisking constantly to
  combine it with the roux. Add salt and coarsely ground black pepper. Keep
  whisking until the gravy is thick and tastes good.
* Serve by cutting a biscuit in half and laying it open faced on the plate. Drop
  a little gravy onto the biscuit so the sausage has something to stick to. Then
  place some sausage crumbles on top of that, and then drizzle more gravy on top
  of that.
