# Guiness Stew

## Notes
* I like to serve this in a bread bowl. I think the perfect thing would be an
  overlarge pretzel roll. I've never done that, though. Whatever you use, since
  it has to hold liquid, try to use a denser or tougher bread, or something with
  a thick crust.

## Ingredients
* 1.5 - 2 lbs. beef short ribs (bone-in)
* Kosher salt
* Black pepper
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 medium yellow onion
* 2-3 large, full thyme twigs
* 1 14.9 oz can Guiness Draught
* 1/4 cup molasses
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp Kitchen Bouquet
* 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce
* 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
* 4 tbsp tomato past4 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 russett potatoes or equivalent amount of new potatoes
* 3 large carrots
* 64 oz Beef broth

## Tools
* Dutch oven
* Vegetable peeler
* Knives for carving meat and cutting vegetables
* Plate for resting meat

## Prep
* Peel the carrots and cut them into large chunks, at least one inch across.
* If using russett potatoes, peel them. If using new potatoes, clean and scrub
  them. If the new potatoes are very big, consider halving them. Russetts should
  be chunked to the same size as the carrots.
* Peel the onion; cut it in half, then slice thinly.

## Directions
0. Place the short ribs meat side up on a chopping block and sprinkle them with
   kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Allow them to sit 5-10 minutes.
0. Melt butter in a dutch oven on the stove over medium heat. Place the ribs in
   the butter, meat side down, and let them sear for about 5 minutes.
0. Remove the meat to a plate. Put the sliced onions and whole thyme twigs into
   the dutch oven. Stirring occasionally, caramelize the onions.
0. Pour in the full can of Guiness, which will bubble and foam. Allow this to
   settle, then add the molasses, brown sugar, Kitchen Bouquet, worcestershire
   sauce, and soy sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir and dissolve the sugar.
0. Return the ribs to the dutch oven, bone side down. Allow to simmer for at
   least two hours, occasionally unsticking the meat and stirring. If the bones
   fall off the meat, leave them in the dutch oven to simmer.
0. At this point, you can actually just keep simmering the sauce down until it's
   a glaze, and the ribs can be served just like that, maybe with some roasted
   or mashed potatoes on the side. If it's stew you desire, keep cooking.
0. Remove the meat and discard the bones. Carve the meat into large chunks and
   return to the dutch oven. Over medium heat, dissolve the tomato paste in.
   Pour in 32 oz of beef broth. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium
   low. Cover and let simmer for at least an hour, stirring every so often.
   The broth should reduce and become thick again.
0. Allow to cool a bit so the fat rises to the top. Skim most of the fat away.
0. Add the carrots and potatoes. Stir in enough beef broth to cover the
   vegetables. Salt to taste.
0. Monitor the stew for the next half hour to an hour. Add beef broth if the
   stew becomes too thick. The vegetables will absorb a good deal of fluid, so
   keep an eye on the broth level. The stew is done when the vegetables are soft
   all the way through and the broth is thick and rich. If the stew needs
   thickening, make a slurry of all purpose flour and beef broth, then stir it
   in little by little, allowing the stew to boil a bit each time, until it's
   done.
0. Serve in a bread bowl.
