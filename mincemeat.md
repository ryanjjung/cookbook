# Holiday Mincemeat with Rum Butter

## Notes
* This recipe produces a filling. You'll want to fill a pie or something with it.
* This recipe produces a ridiculous amount of food. You may want to halve it, or freeze some.

## Ingredients
### Mincemeat
* 1 lb sour apples
* 8 oz shredded suet
* 12 oz raisins
* 8 oz sultanas
* 8 oz currants
* 8 oz mixed candied peel
* 12 oz dark brown sugar
* Zest and juice of 2 oranges
* Zest and juice of 2 lemons
* 2 oz slivered almonds
* 4 tsp allspice
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 grated nutmeg
* 6 tbsp brandy

### Rum Butter
* 6 oz room temperature unsalted butter
* 6 oz dark brown sugar
* 6 tbsp rum

## Tools
* Large mixing bowl
* Sturdy wooden spoon
* Clean dishcloth
* Large casserole dish
* Aluminum foil

## Prep
* Zest and juice the oranges and lemons
* If you have whole almonds, sliver them in advance
* Finely chop the candied peel
  * If you can't find candied peel to buy, you can make it yourself. Sliver the peel and boil it in
    a half-and-half mixture of sugar and water until the liquid reduces. Using tongs, set the peel
    on a rack to cool and sprinkle with more sugar as it dries. Wait a couple hours before chopping.

## Directions
### Mincemeat
* Combine all ingredients *except for the brandy* in a large mixing bowl.
* Cover the bowl with a clean dishcloth and leave to sit for 12 hours, or at least overnight.
* Transfer the mixture to a large casserole dish. Cover with foil and bake at 225Â°F for 3 hours.
* When it comes out, it will be extremely fatty and greasy. This is normal. As the mixture cools,
  stir it frequently to mix in the fat so it forms a coating of the other ingredients.
* When the mixture is completely cool, stir in the brandy.

### Rum Butter
* Using a hand or stand mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until it is pale and creamy.
* Gradually add the rum a little at a time. Adding too much at once can cause the butter to split.
* Chill before serving.
