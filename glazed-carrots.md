# Honey Fennel Carrots

## Notes
* When selecting carrots, choose them to fit the pan you're cooking them in.
  Some should be shorter than others to fit the round edges of the pan while
  others should be longer to stretch the full width at the center.
* If you're a heathen who doesn't like fennel, use terragon instead.

## Ingredients
* 6-10 large carrots
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 tsp fennel seeds
* 1 tbsp honey
* ~2 cups of hot water

## Tools
* Tongs
* 10-12" metal skillet with lid
* Small rubber spatula

## Prep
* Peel the carrots and trim both ends

## Directions
* Heat the skillet up over medium-low heat. Drop in the butter and let it melt.
  Stir in the fennel seeds with the rubber spatula.
* Cook the butter, stirring it with the spatula or swirling the pan occasionally
  to brown the butter and fry the fennel.
* Add the honey and stir until the sweetened butter mixture is smooth.
* Drop in the carrots, which will cool the pan and stop the browning. Raise the
  heat to medium and let the pan's temperature come back up. Using the tongs,
  roll the carrots in the butter to coat them. When the butter begins to sizzle
  again, pour the water in. Cover and allow the water to boil.
* Cook covered for 20 minutes or more, depending on the thickness of the carrots.
  They are done cooking when you can insert a fork into the thickest part of the
  thickest carrot and feel almost no resistance. During this time, the water
  will evaporate. If you need to add more water to complete the cooking, do so.
* When the carrots are all fully cooked, remove the lid. Allow the water to
  continue to boil until it is reduced to a thick sauce that sticks to a spoon
  and coats the carrots.
* Remove the carrots to a plate. Retain the excess sauce and glaze the carrots
  once more immediately before serving.
