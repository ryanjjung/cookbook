# Eggplant Lasagna

## Notes
* This is a recipe of four components, three of which require prior cooking or
  prep. You can cook the sauce and meat mix a few days before assembly. It's
  best to prep the eggplant right before using it.

## Ingredients
* 1-2 cups ricotta cheese
* 12 oz shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2 large eggplants
* Kosher salt
* Ingredients for sauce and meat mix below

### Tomato Sauce
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 large yellow or white onion
* Blend of spices (your choice, but here is mine):
  * Marjoram
  * Thyme
  * Basil
  * Coriander seed
  * Fennel seed
  * Kosher salt
  * Crushed red pepper
  * Oregano
* 8-10 cloves garlic
* 8-10 very ripe tomatoes
* 14.5 oz can tomato sauce
* 4 tbsp tomato paste

### Meat Mix
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 lb Italian sausage
* 1 lb ground beef
* Blend of spices (same as in the tomato sauce)


## Tools
* Dutch oven or other large lidded pot
* Rubber spatula
* Potato masher
* Largish bowl
* Large cast iron skillet, or other similar pan
* Mandolin
* Cling wrap
* Paper towels
* Colander
* Deep 9"x13" casserole dish

## Directions
### Make the sauce
* Trim the stems out of the tomatoes, cut them in half. Slightly pre-smash them in a bowl with the
  potato masher to get some juice loosened. Dice the garlic. Dice the onion.
* Heat up olive oil in a dutch oven or other large lidded pot over medium heat, or slightly lower.
* Stir in the diced onion and spice blend. Cook 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions
  are translucent.
* Add the diced garlic. Stir a couple times over 45 seconds. When smelling the mixture directly
  above the pot stings your nose, pour in the tomatoes, juice and all. Stir, then mash the tomatoes
  as best you can. They will be firm, so don't expect good smashing right away.
* Cover the pot and turn the heat slightly down. Allow to simmer for a while, as much as 30 minutes,
  stirring and smashing every 5-10 minutes. The longer the tomatoes cook, the softer they'll get,
  and the easier they'll smash.
* When the tomatoes are pretty well smashed (you can remove any tough core pieces that don't want to
  smash even after cooking a while), add the tomato sauce and paste. Stir, cover, simmer and stir
  for another half hour or so. You can stop when the sauce has thickened a bit, reduced by about
  a quarter or half.

### Make the meat mix
* Preheat the skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil, then both meats. Brown the meat, breaking it
  up as it cooks. When the meat has released some fat and becomes moist, stir in the spice blend.
* Continue breaking up the meat as it cooks into quite small pieces, which makes it spread better
  later.

### Prepare the eggplant
* Cut off the crown and base of the eggplant. Peel its skin off. It's edible, but too tough for
  lasagna.
* Preferably using a mandolin, but a super sharp knife if you must, slice the eggplant into very
  thin rounds.
* Place the rounds in a large mixing bowl. Cover with copious amounts of kosher salt. Using a
  rubber spatula or some other blunt tool that won't destroy the eggplant, stir the eggplant and
  salt together. Let sit a minute. Brown brine will appear on the eggplant. Stir this up, further
  coating the eggplant. Cover in cling wrap and let sit another 5 minutes.
* Transfer the eggplant to a colander. Run cold water over the eggplant. Manipulate it with your
  hands under the water to thoroughly wash the brine off the eggplant. Failure to do this well
  results in an incredibly salty and completely inedible meal. Don't skimp out on this. Wash for at
  least 2-3 straight minutes.
* Lay out a double layer of paper towels. I do this on top of a cutting board to make cleanup easier.
  Spread the eggplant pieces out on the towels as flatly as you can. The washing procedure tends to
  remove the inner seeds when the eggplant is cut so thin. This weakens the eggplant and causes it
  to tear. That's ok, just get things flat. If you need to, you can make multiple layers of
  eggplant, but be sure to put a layer of paper towels between them. Top the eggplant off with
  another double layer of paper towels. Gently press down on the top of the stack, absorbing more
  brown liquid with the towels.
* Carefully remove the paper towels and transfer the eggplant slices back to a bowl.

### Prepare the casserole
* Use a large spoon to create the lasagna layers.
* Spread a super thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom. This only serves to prevent sticking, so
  you really don't need much.
* Begin with an eggplant layer. The bottom layer of eggplant will form the bottom structure of the
  lasagna, so be a little more thorough than on later layers.
* Next, spread a fairly thin sauce layer on.
* Now crumble a layer of meat mix on.
* Now spread some ricotta cheese. Ricotta is thick and wants a solid base to smear, but you don't
  have that. You have a mushy, slick mixture, and smearing the ricotta around will ruin the layers
  under it. So place small dollops and smash it down. If you don't get 100% coverage on the layer,
  it's fine. It's going to melt and run out during cooking. You won't notice in the finished product.
* Keep layering in this way, reserving a small amount of the sauce. You should get roughly three
  total layer patterns - eggplant, sauce, meat, cheese - finishing with a layer of ricotta dollops.
* Top the casserole first with the remaining sauce, and then with the mozzarella cheese.
* Bake on the center rack of the oven at 300Â°F for 50 minutes.
* Bring the temperature up to a broil and cook for no more than 5 more minutes, browning and
  crisping the mozzarella layer.
* Allow to sit 10 minutes before serving.
