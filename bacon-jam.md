# Bacon Jam

## Notes
- Serve with pork chops or on a sandwich

## Ingredients
- 1 lb bacon
- 1 large red onion
- 5-6 cloves garlic
- Herbs (thyme, rosemary, mint, whatever you have on hand)
- 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/3 cup packed brown sugar

## Tools
- Skillet
- Firm metal spatula

## Prep
- Slice the bacon into 1 inch strips
- Halve the onion, then slice into thin strips
- Mince the garlic
- Trim and clean the herbs

## Directions
- Heat the skillet over medium (or a little hotter) heat.
- Add the bacon to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, until the bacon is nearly crisp.
- Drain all but a few tablespoons of grease off. Keep your grease. You may need it later.
- Add the red onions, garlic, and herbs to the pan and reduce heat to low. Stir frequently. Have patience. Cook slowly until the onions are very soft and tender and are beginning to caramelize. If the pan begins to dry out, the onions may burn. To prevent this, add reserved bacon grease back to the pan a spoonful at a time as needed to keep the skillet moist.
- Add the balsamic vinegar. Be careful, as it will sputter. Add the brown sugar right after. Stir this together into a lumpy syrup. Use the metal spatula to scrape the bacon drippings up from the pan. Stir those in as well.
- Return the bacon pieces to the skillet. Continue to stir and heat over low-medium heat until the syrup thickens enough to coat a spoon.
