# Marinara Sauce

## Notes

* Marinara should feel a bit chunky and thick, but it should not have large vegetable
  chunks in it. For this reason, you must use petite diced tomatoes, not just regular
  diced tomatoes, and you must dice the onion finely, and you must crush the garlic.
* The rosemary, oregano, fennel, and thyme can be exchanged for dry italian seasoning.
* To turn this into pizza sauce, just add an extra can of paste.
* Simmer the sauce for at least 20 minutes, but up to one hour. Longer simmer times help
  increase the flavor of the sauce.

## Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 1 small white onion
* Rosemary
* Oregano
* Thyme
* Fennel
* 8 cloves garlic
* 1 15oz can petite diced tomatoes
* 1 15oz can tomato sauce
* 1 can tomato paste
* Kosher salt
* Black pepper

## Prep

* You'll need a medium saucepan, a stirring spoon, cutting knives, and a cutting board.
* Finely dice the onion.
* Finely chop rosemary, oregano, and thyme. You'll need about a half tablespoon of each.
* Use ground fennel, or grind your own with a mortar and pestle. You only need a teaspoon.
* Peel the garlic.
* Open the various tomato cans.

## Directions

0. Put enough olive oil in the saucepan to cover the bottom, 1-2 tbsp. Raise stovetop
   to medium heat.
0. When the oil is hot, add the diced onions, rosemary, oregano, thyme, and fennel. Cook
   them over medium heat until the onion is translucent, 5-8 minutes, stirring often.
0. Crush the garlic into the saucepan and stir it in. Allow to cook for 30-60 seconds,
   until the smell is very pungent over the saucepan.
0. Pour in diced tomatoes, then the tomato sauce, then the tomato paste. Stir until the
   paste thickens the sauce and is dissolved into it completely. Reduce heat to low and
   simmer (see notes).

## Suggestions

Cook with spaghetti noodles or penne pasta. Add a meat, such as chicken or meatballs. Or
try eggplant or chicken parmesan. Great with fried mozzarella.
