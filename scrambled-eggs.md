# Scrambled Eggs

## Notes

Keys to great scrambled eggs:
* Use 1 Tbsp half-n-half per 2 eggs.
* Use 1 crack of pepper per egg, plus 2
* Whip furiously in a front to over-the-top to back motion, creating large bubbles with the membrane
* Cook "low and slow" â€” Put the burner a little above the "low" setting and cook the eggs with patience
* Salt absorbs liquid, so don't add it until the very end of the cook time. It should go in maybe 60 seconds before the eggs are done.
* When you do add salt, go easy on it. A light dusting of kosher salt across the top of the eggs is sufficient.
* Eggs continue to cook on their residual heat after being removed from the pan. If it's done in the pan, it's overdone when you serve it. Move the eggs to a serving bowl while they're still a bit moist, and let them rest for a minute before serving.

## Ingredients
(Served with bacon or sausage, this recipe feeds four)

* 2 Tbsp butter (or bacon grease)
* 8 eggs
* 1/4 cup half-n-half
* Kosher salt
* 10 cracks of black peppercorns

## Prep
* You'll need a skillet big enough to hold the ingredients, a rubber spatula, a mixing bowl, and a serving bowl
* In a bowl, whip together the eggs and half-n-half (see notes)

## Directions
0. Melt butter/grease in a skillet over low-to-medium-low heat.
0. Pour in the eggs. Use the rubber spatula to get all the egg off the walls of the mixing bowl.
0. Stir the eggs as they cook, forming them as they solidify into a small mound an inch or two high in the center of the skillet. Stir and flip the eggs a few times, until they are *almost* done.
0. Sprinkle kosher salt over the eggs. Crack in 10 fresh cracks of pepper. Stir it up.
0. Allow to cook for just a bit longer. When the eggs are nearly done (see notes), remove them to a mixing bowl. Let them rest a minute before serving.
