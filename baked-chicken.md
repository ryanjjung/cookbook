# Baked Chicken with Vegetable Gravy

## Notes
* A whole chicken takes a long time to thaw. Get that started the day before
  you cook this.
* For large groups, this dinner doubles easily. You can use either two roasting
  pans next to each other, or one very large roasting pan for both chickens.
  As long as the chickens do not touch, the cook time doesn't need adjustment.
* The ingredients below list "herbs". You can use whatever you like. Things that
  are good: rosemary, thyme, sage, basil, terragon, etc.
* After you eat this, save all the bones and the entire carcass and anything
  leftover from the pan and make chicken broth.

## Ingredients
* One whole chicken
* 2 onions
* 5 carrots
* 5 stalks celery
* 2 tomatoes
* 8 cloves garlic
* 1 lemon
* Herbs
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar

## Tools
* Tongs / meat fork / utensils for handling raw chicken
* 9x13 roasting pan
* Sharp knife

## Prep
* Cut each onion into wedges.
* Cut each carrot into three pieces by cutting across the carrot in half, then
  down the length of the thicker length of carrot.
* Cut the celery into lengths to match the carrots.
* Cut the tomatoes into large wedges.
* Peel the garlic.
* Cut the lemon across into round halves.

## Directions
* Place a double layer of paper towels across a cutting board. Place the whole
  chicken on the paper towels right-side up. Dispose of the innards and hollow
  out the bird. Use more paper towels to pat it dry.
* Stuff the cavity with a handful of carrots, celery, onion, and herbs. Salt
  and pepper the top of the chicken.
* Arrange the remaining carrot sticks, celery stalks, onion wedges, tomatoes,
  and garlic cloves evenly around the bottom of the roasting pan.
* Place the chicken on top of the vegetables. This should create a gap between
  the pan surface and the bottom of the chicken, allowing a pan juice to form
  as it bakes.
* Arrange remaining herbs around the chicken.
* Heat oven to 350F. Place the roasting pan on the middle rack.
* Cook until a meat thermometer registers 165F in the thickest part of a
  breast. You want to measure the temperature near - but not touching - a bone.
  Actual cook time will vary depending on the size of the bird. After about 45
  minutes of cooking, check the temperature. It won't be done, but you'll get
  an idea for how close it is. Continue to cook, checking the temp every 20
  minutes until you get quite close to 165F, then play it by ear. Do not serve
  undercooked chicken.
* Remove the chicken to a carving board and let it rest while you make the
  gravy.
* Pour all of the pan leftovers - the juice as well as all of the vegetables
  and herbs - into a blender cup. Blend until it reaches a thick, fluid
  consistency. If the mixture is too thick, you can thin it with chicken broth.
* Once it reaches a good consistency, pour it into a saucepan. Add the apple
  cider vinegar and stir it in. You can add some additional chopped herbs if
  you like. When the gravy is hot, it's ready to serve.
* Carve the chicken. Serve with gravy.
