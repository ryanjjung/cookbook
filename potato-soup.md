# Fully Loaded Baked Potato Soup

## Notes
* This is hearty and fatty. It feels good, but isn't terribly healthy. To decrease flavor and
  increase healthiness, use lower fat dairy products. Don't use skim milk, as it takes all the soul
  and love and heartiness out of this dish.
* It's crucial to make your own bacon bits as described in this recipe. More than just garnish, the
  grease from it adds a bacony flavor in the broth of the soup, and it's pretty much why everyone
  likes this meal.

## Ingredients
* 6 bacon strips
* 1/2 smoked sausage (of any kind, but I like Eckrich)
* 1 medium white onion
* 4 carrots
* 2 celery stalks
* 3 medium russett potatoes
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1 quart half and half
* 2 green onions, or equivalent amount of chives
* 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
* kosher salt
* black pepper

# Tools
* Dutch oven or soup pot
* Vegetable peeler
* Knives for prep work, and a cutting board
* Rubber spatula or wooden spoon for stirring

# Prep
* Peel the carrots and potatoes
* Cut the carrots into half-inch rounds
* Cut the potatoes into half-inch cubes
* Cut the bacon into one-inch strips
* Slice the celery into quarter-inch moons
* Peel the onion, then dice it finely
* Finely slice the green onions for garnish
* Slice the sausage into quarter-inch rounds
* Shred the cheddar cheese

# Directions
* Preheat a dutch oven on the stove over medium heat for about 5 minutes. While it's heating,
  prepare a plate with paper towels over it.
* Drop the bacon strips into the hot pot. You can slightly cover the pot with a lid to prevent
  grease splatter, but leave room for liquid to evaporate. Stir the bacon pretty frequently. Allow
  the bacon to cook a bit past done, getting crispy and slightly burnt.
* Using tongs (so that most of the grease remains in the dutch oven), remove the bacon to the
  toweled plate. Using excess paper towel, press the bacon to soak the grease out of it. This makes
  the bacon fragile and crumbly. Set it aside, as you won't need it again until serving time.
* Reduce the stove temp to medium low and return the pot to the stovetop. Add 1/4 cup of the flour.
  Mix it into the grease to form a roux. If you need to add more flour to thicken the roux, add it
  one tablespoon at a time until it's thick and doughy.
* Add the celery, onions, and carrots to the roux. Mix well, raising the heat back to medium, and
  cook for 3-5 minutes until the veggie juices start to release. Stir the liquid into the roux,
  slightly thinning it. Brown the roux, but don't burn it. Reduce heat if need be, and cook,
  stirring regularly, for another 3-5 minutes.
* When the roux is thick and bready and sticky, stir in about half a cup of half and half, which
  will make it looser. Now add the sausage and potatoes, stir them in, and add the rest of the half
  and half. Add salt and pepper. Stir it up.
* Raise the stove temp to medium-high to slowly bring the heat up to a boil, then reduce the temp
  to medium/medium-low to maintain a low simmer. Cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Stir and
  unstick the pot a few times throughout.
* When you can cut straight through the potatoes easily with a wooden spoon, it's done. Test for
  flavor, and stir in more salt if needed.
* To serve, ladle soup into bowls, then garnish with shredded cheddar, then crushed bacon bits, and
  finally green onions or chives.
