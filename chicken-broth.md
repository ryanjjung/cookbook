# Homemade Chicken Broth

## Notes
* To begin, you need to bake a chicken.
* Treat this recipe as a guideline. This is a great way to get rid of veggies
  that are nearly expired because nobody will ever actually eat the veggies
  themselves. You just need their flavor in the broth.
* Use this broth to make chicken soup.

## Ingredients
* Carcass from a baked chicken
* Lots of veggies; pick and choose from this list, or find your own:
  * Carrots
  * Onions
  * Celery
  * Garlic cloves
  * Cabbage
  * Leftover broccoli stems
  * Tomatoes

## Tools
* Large stock pot
* Wooden spoon
* Two large bowls
* Collander
* Fine mesh seive
* Large storage container

## Prep
* Vegetables need minimal prep. Cut them into very large, rough cuts. No need
  to peel carrots or anything.

## Directions
* Place the chicken carcass and all of your vegetables into a stock pot.
* Add enough water to cover an inch or two over the chicken. Add plenty of salt
  and a bit of pepper.
* Bring to a boil.
* Reduce heat to medium or medium low and allow to cook for several hours.
  Every 20 minutes or so, use the wooden spoon to stir the broth, and most
  importantly, to break up the bones and vegetables as they soften. You want to
  release all of that delicious juice into the broth.
* After several hours of cooking, allow the broth to cool to a manageable
  temperature.
* Pour the broth through a collander into one large bowl to filter out the bones
  and larger veggie chunks. Discard the solids. Pass the liquid from one bowl
  to the other through a fine mesh seive. Do this twice, cleaning the seive
  between passes. This removes the finer solids and a good bit of the fat.
* Pour the broth into a storage container and leave to refrigerate overnight.
* Once chilled, the fats in the broth will have accumulated and solidified on
  top. You can pass the broth through a seive one more time to ensure all of
  that fat gets removed.
