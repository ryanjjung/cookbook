# Marinara Bisque

## Notes

* This recipe implies you have made the [marinara sauce](marinara-sauce.md) recipe in
  this cookbook.
* This is a twist on a more usual tomato bisque, which is a blend of cooked tomatoes
  with onions and some seasonings. This recipe only borrows the flavors of marinara
  sauce to provide some variety.

## Ingredients

* 3 cups marinara sauce
* Up to 1 cup heavy cream

## Tools

* Smoothie blender (or an immersion blender as an alternative)
* Medium saucepan
* Rubber spatula

## Prep

* Just measure things out ahead of time

## Directions

1. Begin by making marinara sauce.
1. Add cream to the sauce to your desired level of creaminess and stir.
1. Use the blender to puree the mixture until completely smooth. A smoothie blender works
   best and fastest for this, although most smoothie blenders are quite small, requiring
   you to do multiple batches. Immersion blenders are slow and produce less reliably smooth
   results, but they more or less get the job done.
1. Add the smooth bisque back to the stove in a medium saucepan and reheat, stirring with
   the spatula to prevent splatter, and serve hot.

## Serving Suggestions

This works great as a creamy noodle sauce. Add other ingredients to make it more substantial,
like pan-grilled chicken, poached shrimp, or lightly cooked zucchini chunks.

It's also great for dipping grilled cheese sandwiches in. Try a sandwich with [homemade
sourdough bread](sourdough-bread.md), fresh grated mozzarella cheese, and pepperonis.
