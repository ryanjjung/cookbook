# Fried Brussels Sprouts

## Notes
* This is the only good way to cook brussels sprouts

## Ingredients
* Brussels sprouts
* Rendered bacon fat
* Ground cinnamon
* Juice of half a lemon

## Tools
* Tongs
* Cast iron skillet

## Prep
* Cut each brussels sprout in half across the base so as to have a flat surface
  to cook them on. You'll lose some outer leaves, but if you cut across the
  base as described, there should be enough there to hold the bulk of it
  together.
* The bacon fat comes from bacon that you've cooked previously. If you don't
  normally keep old bacon fat, you can cook up about 4 slices of bacon, eat
  the bacon, and set the fat aside.

## Directions
* Heat up the cast iron skillet for a few minutes over medium heat.
* Acting quickly so that the bacon fat doesn't smoke, add a dollop (maybe 2-3
  tablespoons) of bacon fat to the skillet. It'll melt; you'll spread it evenly
  across the pan. Now sprinkle salt, pepper, and ground cinnamon evenly across
  the pan (it'll foam slightly).
* Before everything burns, begin adding the brussels sprouts flat side down
  into the grease.
* Squeeze the lemon juice over the tops of the brussels sprouts.
* Allow to fry about 5 minutes. The bottoms of the sprouts should be fairly
  blackened.
* Remove from heat and serve.
